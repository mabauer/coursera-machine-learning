Coursera Machine Learning
=========================

These are my solutions to the exercises for Stanford's Machine Learning course on Coursera: 
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info

On some of the exercises, I use Matlab (or Octave) as suggested by the course's teacher Andrew Ng.
For some of them, I provide a solution in Python + numPy.

I think that using Jupyter Notebooks for these exercises is a great idea, they work nicely with Octave and Python.
For details on how to run Jupyter Notebooks with Octave, see: https://github.com/Calysto/octave_kernel
